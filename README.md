# CSCI 3330 Project 1: RSA - An Asymmetric Cryptosystem for Cybersecurity
[RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) is a public-key cryptosystem that is widely used for secure data transmission. It is also one of the oldest. 
The acronym "RSA" comes from the surnames of Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman, who publicly described the algorithm in 1977.
## About
This is a Python project put together by Shandon Probst, Grant Fugate, and Nickolas Paternoster and implements the RSA cryptosystem. 
The project was designed for Dr. Chenyi Hu's CSCI 3330 Algorithms course, in which we were to design and implement a functional RSA cryptosystem as our first project in the course.
## Installation
Simply download all files and place within the directory from which you plan to run the main file (**front_end.py**) from.
